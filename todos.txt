1. make neural network module
  ctor:
    nodes per layer
      recommended value unknown
    connection strategy
      enum:
        EachToEach
          connects every node from layer n-1 to every node from layer n
        SparseRandom
          connects every node from layer n-1 to a set percentage of the nodes from the next layer (randomly)
  api:
    ???
2. make a neural network trainer
  api:
    train(neural_network, training_set, iterations)
      trains neural network with a training set a given number of iterations (using backpropagation)
3. Generate datasets somehow or adapt them from an online dataset
4. Display the neural network inputs and output
